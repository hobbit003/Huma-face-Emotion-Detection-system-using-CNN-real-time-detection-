## Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for a real-time human facial emotion detection system developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project explores the significance of facial expressions in non-verbal communication and aims to build an intelligent system capable of recognizing multiple emotions simultaneously.

---

## Key Features
- Real-time facial emotion detection using CNN.
- Capability to recognize multiple emotions simultaneously.
- Training on a dataset comprising images representing seven core emotions.
- Utilization of CNN for efficient image classification and object recognition.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Dataset collection from Kaggle, consisting of images representing various facial expressions.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Normalization, resizing, and optional augmentation techniques.
3. **CNN Architecture**: Custom-designed CNN architecture for facial emotion recognition.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
